# TILs

TIL stands for "Today I Learned," made popular on
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned). Here are some examples of
TILs:

- TIL that there is no real JSON standard for iOS apps
- TIL that Ernest Hemingway would stop writing mid-sentence so he knew where to
  pick it up the other day
- TIL how to use Erlang's FTP library in Elixir
- TIL that Rails ServiceObjects clean up controller logic

TILs are valuable because they let a busy person keep up on what they’ve
learned and to speed up “how do I” discovery time in teams. I would use
something like this extensively if I had it. For organizations, I think it
would be a useful tool for training new hires, apprentices and others who are
trying to figure out how to do something that has been done a thousand times
before but isn't documented well.

# tilsio
